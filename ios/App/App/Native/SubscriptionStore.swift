/// StoreKit 2, and only StoreKit 2 — no third-party purchase SDK.
///
/// What this store owns: loading the two subscription products,
/// running a purchase, restoring purchases, and reporting the
/// device's current Apple entitlements.
///
/// What it deliberately does NOT own: ACCESS. A verified StoreKit
/// entitlement is shown on the paywall as information, but the
/// door into the app is the backend approval (ApprovalStore),
/// exactly as on the web. Purchase completion therefore ends in a
/// "finishing setup" state whose only job is to re-ask the backend
/// until Apple's server notification (via the IAP bridge) lands
/// the approved_emails row. If that row never lands, this store
/// cannot and will not let anyone in locally.
///
/// APP-ACCOUNT TOKEN: every purchase passes the signed-in Supabase
/// user id as StoreKit's appAccountToken. Supabase Auth user ids
/// ARE UUIDs (auth.users.id is a uuid), so the mapping is the
/// identity mapping — UUID(uuidString: user.id) — with no derived
/// or hashed substitute. The bridge reads appAccountToken back out
/// of Apple's signed transaction and resolves it to the account's
/// email through the Supabase Auth admin API. If a session ever
/// presents a non-UUID id, purchase is refused with an honest
/// message rather than buying under an unlinkable token.
